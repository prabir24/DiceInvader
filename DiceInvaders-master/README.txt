DICE Invaders Assignment
========================

Create the game "DICE Invaders" using the supplied library. This assignment is
the basis for the discussions at the technical interview.

Please read and consider the following instructions. Treat the assignment as you
would a task given to you in a working environment. 

We kindly ask that you do not input your name anywhere in the assignment. We 
want to remove any unconscious bias when the team is reviewing your assignment.

Rules of the Game 
-----------------
 
### Description 
DICE Invaders consists of four different objects: the player ship, the aliens,
the aliens' bombs and the player's rockets. The goal of the game is to shoot as
many aliens as possible without being hit by them or their bombs. 
 
### The player ship 
The player ship is positioned at the bottom of the screen. It can only move
horizontally. It can fire rockets at the aliens. The ship can take three hits
from aliens or their bombs before it is destroyed and the game is over. 
 
### The rockets 
The rockets travel straight up. If they hit an alien, the alien and the rocket
are destroyed, and the player's score is increased. Rockets cannot destroy
bombs. When the rocket reaches the top of the screen, it disappears. 

### The aliens 
The aliens start out at the top left corner of the screen, organized in rows and
columns. They move slowly to the right, until the rightmost alien reaches the
border of the screen. Then, they all take one step down, and start travel to the
left instead. If the alien collides with the player, the alien is destroyed and
the player's health is decreased. The aliens drop bombs randomly. 
 
### The bombs 
The bombs travel straight down. If they hit the player, the player's health is
decreased and the bomb is destroyed. A bomb disappears when it is outside the
bottom of the screen. The bombs don't hurt other aliens. 
 
### The end of the game 
If the player is hit three times by aliens or their bombs, or an alien reaches
the bottom of the screen, the player loses and the game is over. If the player
kills all aliens, a new alien army should be created at the top of the screen. 
 

Compiling the Game (Windows)
----------------------------

### Basics
- Launch a Visual Studio command line environment (with nmake.exe and cl.exe in
  the path)
- CD to the unzipped assignment
- Run `nmake` to build the code
- Run `DiceInvaders.exe`

### Additional Build Targets
- `nmake` - builds a debug version of the game
- `nmake release` - builds an optimized version of the game
- `nmake dev` - build a debug version and opens up the game in the visual studio
  environment.
- `nmake clean` - cleans up the directory from intermediate files


Compiling the Game (Linux and macOS)
------------------------------------
(Only tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and macOS 10.12)

### Basics
- CD to the unzipped assignment
- CD into the "sdl" directory
- Make sure you have SDL2 installed
  - Linux: `sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev` (depending on distro)
  - macOS: Install the development libraries from [libsdl.org](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) into `/Library/Frameworks`
- Run `make -f makefile.sdl` to build the code
- Run `./DiceInvaders`

### Additional Build Targets
- `make -f makefile.sdl` - builds the game
- `make -f makefile.sdl clean` - cleans up the directory from intermediate files


Implementation 
--------------

### Files

`DiceInvaders.cpp`
- Contains scaffolding code to get you started. Add as many files as you see
  fit, but make sure the project can be compiled using nmake as described above.

`Engine.h` (Do not edit!)
- The library interface. Should be self-documented.

`Engine.cpp` (Do not edit!)
- The implementation of the library.

`makefile`
- Simple makefile for compiling the game. Keep this makefile up to date if you
  add files to the project.

`makefile.sdl`
- Makefile for compiling the game on macOS and Linux with SDL support.

### Target Hardware 
Assume you are targeting hardware where: 

- The CPU clock-frequency is low. 
- Cache misses are very expensive. 
- Branches are expensive. (No branch prediction). 
- Memory is a limited resource. (No virtual memory). 
- Memory allocations are expensive. 


Quality Criteria
----------------

We will look at your software and consider: 

- Clarity. 
  - Is it easy to follow the flow of the code? 
  - Is it easy to understand what the code does? 
  - Do your comments add information? 
- Simplicity.
  - Are there any unnecessary abstractions? 
  - Are the algorithms used as simple as possible? 
- Performance. 
  - Will the code run efficiently on the target hardware? 
  - For example, does the code make good use of the cache? 
 
Prepare for the interview by knowing your code and be prepared to explain and
elaborate on the decisions you make. 
 
*Remember that this is your chance to make an impression.*
 
*Feel free to deviate from the above, but remember to have clear reasoning
behind your decisions. If you are applying for a specialist role, we also value
if this shows or is reflected in your solution and argumentation.*
 

What to Send to DICE 
--------------------

- The game must build and work on targeted platform according to the instructions above.
- Engine.cpp and Engine.h should be without edits. The only exceptions are edits to the SDL platform layer to make it work on your operating system.
- Create and submit the project as a zip archive named `DiceInvaders_<your name>.zip`
- Don't include any executables (*.exe and *.dll) or other intermediate files
  (do a `nmake clean` or `make -f makefile.sdl clean` before zipping).
